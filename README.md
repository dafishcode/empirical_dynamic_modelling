# empirical_dynamical_modelling
Repo for running empirical dynamical modelling techniques on data - using convergent cross mapping, simplex and lagged coordinate embedding. 


'CCM' - visualisation of CCM predictability in seizure data, functions to and pre-process for CCM and run CCM/EDM - work in progress!

## What is this repo for?
* the implementation of convergent cross mapping (CCM) on time series data
* the analysis and visualisation of CCM results 

## What does this repo contain?
* Modules contain functions for running convergent cross mapping and evaluating CCM results
* Accompanying ipynotebooks demonstrate how to use the modules

### Modules
'admin_functions.py' - useful administrative functions useful 

'CCM.py' - functions for implementing convergent cross mapping

### Notebooks

'CCM_run.ipynb' - running and implementing CCM algorithm

'CCM_eval.ipynb' - evaluating and analysing CCM results
